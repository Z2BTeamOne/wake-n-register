<h1>Why All The Changes?</h1>
<p>HyperLedger Composer has gone through two significant changes in 4Q2017. 
    The first, Version 0.14, changed how security worked and clarified the difference between the business network administrator (admin) and 
the fabric Administrator (PeerAdmin). While this had little effect on what the Admin user interface could do, it did
change significantly how the underlying code worked in the hlcAdmin.js file and in the autoLoad.js file. The biggest code change 
is that the autoLoad process started issuing Identities instead of just adding members to the registry. The other significant
change required adding two statements to the permissions.acl file. 
</p>
<p>Then Version 0.15 was released and the entire access structure was changed from connection profile + username/password (which is why we had the getSecret() method)
    to idCards. This necessitated changes in some of the scripts we use (buildAndDeploy, startup.sh, deployNetwork.sh), 
    required a complete rewrite for how the test code loads and connects to the network and also required changes in the admin
    interface. You'll see a number of items which have a <span class='strike'>yellow strikethrough</span>, indicating that they 
    are no longer available. 
</p>
<p>We aren't using connection profiles any more as part of the log in process, so that whole section is no longer useful. 
    Because we're using cards, we don't need to use, nor do we need to capture, the user secrets associated with each 
    Member. so that is deactivated. 
</p>
<p>We do, however, need more capability for Members. Along with the Add Member function, which we've had all along, we now need
    the ability to issue an Identity for that Member and then to create an idCard for that member. You'll see those new 
    functions in the Resource Management part of the administrative user interface, along with a feature which will
    check to see if an idCard already exists for a specific member. 
</p>
<p>An Identity can only be issued for an existing Member, so the process is to: <ul><li>Add a Member</li>
    <li>Issue an Identity</li><li>Create an idCard</li></ul>
    Creating an idCard requires the password, or secret, which was generated during the issue Identity process. Each of these 
    functions has been implemented individually. It would be a great idea to combine the issue Identity process with the Create idCard
    process, so that you don't have to remember to copy the generated secret and type it into the createCard page.
